# Contributing to Web POS

Thank you for considering contributing to the **Web POS - Cloud Point of Sale System**! üéâ

We welcome contributions of all types: code, documentation, design, or testing. This guide will help you get started, especially if you are participating in Hacktoberfest.

## üéØ Hacktoberfest Specifics

We are participating in Hacktoberfest! Please follow these guidelines to ensure your Pull Request (PR) is eligible:

1.  **Quality First:** We prioritize high-quality, meaningful contributions. Trivial changes (e.g., pure whitespace cleanup, automated formatting changes without context) may be marked as invalid.
2.  **Valid PRs:** Your PR must be **merged** or be given the **hacktoberfest-accepted** label by a maintainer before the end of October.
3.  **Find the Right Issue:** Look for issues with the **good first issue** or **help wanted** labels for easy starting points.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Contribution Workflow

Here is the standard process for contributing code or documentation:

### 1\. Fork the Repository

Navigate to the main **Web POS** repository on GitHub and click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner. This creates a copy of the repository under your account.

### 2\. Clone Your Fork

Clone your newly forked repository to your local machine using the command line.

`git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pos-web.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/pos-web.git)  cd pos-web`

_(Remember to replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username.)_

### 3\. Create a New Branch

Always create a new, descriptive branch for your work. Never commit directly to the main branch of your fork.

`git checkout -b fix/issue-101-login-validation`

_Use clear names like feat/new-feature-name or fix/bug-description._

### 4\. Make Your Changes

Implement your code fix, add new features, or update documentation. Ensure you test your changes locally.

### 5\. Commit and Push

Stage your changes and commit them with a clean, descriptive message.

`git add .  git commit -m "fix(login): Implement validation for empty username field"  git push origin your-new-branch-name`

### 6\. Create a Pull Request (PR)

1.  Go to your fork on GitHub and click the **Compare & pull request** button.
2.  Set the **base** repository to the original Web-POS repository's main branch.
3.  Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes in the PR template.
4.  Link the PR to any related issues (e.g., Closes #101).
5.  Click **Create pull request**.

## üìù General Guidelines

- **Code Style:** Please try to match the existing coding style of the repository.
- **Documentation:** If you introduce new features, please update the relevant documentation.
- **Be Patient:** Maintainers may be busy, especially during Hacktoberfest. We will review all quality PRs as quickly as possible.

We look forward to your contributions!
